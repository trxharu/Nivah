                    We run around in pouring rains, work in the scorching heat and in the freezing cold, around the
                    clock. Our work means getting sunburns, bruises and cuts. It's months of planning, only hours to
                    put together and minutes to tear down. It's about meeting the nicest clients, turning them into
                    friends and creating something amazing for them.
